Fitness Calculator is an app in which you can easily calculate your BMI (body mass index) and the number of calories for you to maintain your current weight.

- We can work with both imperial and metric units of measures.

## How do I made the calculations?

- Your [BMI] is calculated by only using your height and weight

- The number of calories you need is calculated by using your height, weight, age,
 gender and your activity level.

# Why have we made this app?

I myself am a very healthy person which has been going to the gym for almost 5 years
now, and it took me long enough to realize that if you want to lose, maintain or gain
weight it is essential to have in mind how much calories you need to eat in a
daily basis.

While you are trying to achieve some body shape of your desire, it's possible that you
go underweight, or overweight. But how would you know this?
This is when the BMI Calculator comes in place, because let's say that your weight is
about '165 lb', then this weight would be alright for a 5'' 9' person, but not for a 5''5
person.
> The BMI Calculator let's you check if you are in a healthy body shape.
